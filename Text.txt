1. Bubble Sort (My implementation):
•	Best Case (Already sorted array) : O(n) 
•	Worst Case (Reversed Array): O(n2)
•	Average Case: O(n2)
Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets but easy to implement.

2. Selection Sort
•	Best Case: O(n2)
•	Worst Case: O(n2)
•	Average Case: O(n2)
Selection Sort performs fewer swaps but still has O(n2) complexity.

3. Insertion Sort
•	Best Case: O(n)
•	Worst Case: O(n2)
•	Average Case: O(n2)
Insertion Sort is better than Bubble Sort for nearly sorted arrays.
